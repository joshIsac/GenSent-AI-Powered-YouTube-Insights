us wake up the radio 970 announcement just dropped come on that is right . and finally announced those pus that were first spotted in full retail packaging weeks ago and . I ca not believe . I am saying this but it is even more exciting than . I dared to hope for now we had some idea what was coming of course edna 3.5 showed a solid uplift over edna 3 in handheld we got to look at some version of the ray tracing upgrades in the . PlayStation 5 Pro and obviously . AI was going to be a big . Focus but now it is all coming together in a single package literally they are back to using a monolithic die . I am talking alone edna 4 architecture an enhanced media engine third gen raid tracing accelerators second gene AI accelerators powering . for 4 scaling and 16 gigs of ram at $ 599 and the best part if they i've been shipping these things for months maybe stock perhaps . I am almost afraid to wins it but for the first time and as long as . I can remember . and might not have screwed up a pu launch like . I am going to screw up this uh so to our . sooner next too their alone . Aurora . Pro . Mark . I projector improves on their first generation with a 4,000 to contrast ratio and support for all major . her formats learn more today at the link in the video description [ Music ] feels like we i've been waiting forever for edna 4 but good things come to those who wait right and personally . I am glad that . and let their . Engineers cook we are going to dive a lot deeper when our review goes live next week but for now . and is promising some big uplifts in performance per clock claiming that each . CU or compute unit should be about 40 % faster than edna 3 for those of you who are keeping score at home 40 % is a lot and it supposedly comes courtesy of improved scaler units and dynamic register allocation they i've also got an enhanced memory subsystem which will supposedly help with the compute portions of . Ray tracing workloads now it is too early to say if . and has fully closed the . Gap with . vida when it comes to . Ray tracing but it seems like they are at least promising a major improvement over their last generation accelerators on top of the memory stuff they i've added a second . Ray intersection engine to allegedly double throughput for . Ray box and . Ray triangle testing there is a dedicated . Hardware block for . Ray transformation and a new hardware accelerator feature that they call oriented bounding boxes that is a lot of jargon but what it pretty much boils down to is this thing should trace your rays a lot better and . I am pretty excited about it even if the real world result does not quite match up with vida is latest . I am also excited about and is new . AI accelerators okay . I am not that excited about it but someone is maybe even you with only 16 gigs of ram a piece the two cards that am revealed today wo not be able to handle larger models but the claimed performance improvements for the models that they can handle are pretty big thanks to more math pipelines and expanding the capabilities of their . AI accelerators . and is claiming a two times performance uplift in fp16 and four times in in 8 compared to edna 3 as for how that translates to real world results they showed some slides later comparing the 970 XT to the 7900 are and it does look pretty impressive and who knows maybe you all actually use the . AI features that . and is coming out with like the optional image inspector which is an algorithm that monitors game frames and looks for image corruption during gamelan and the . and chat oh good it is a local large language model that can supposedly help you configure your . pu and tune it neat like how you can keep your desk setup neat with . Magnetic . Cable . Management from . let storeroom speaking of things looking nice the image quality improvements to the media engine look great if their slides are to be believed you could actually stream to . Twitch with one of these cards without it looking like hot garbage let is just hope that along with the better encoding that they finally fixed that weird 1082 P Hardware encoding bug um regardless of that they i've also promised ok 80fps encode and decode support for hic ave and h264 accelerated post-processing effects and no limit on the number of sessions or encoding streams . Team . Green meanwhile locks this behind their professional card pay wall so uh good guy . and but also darn it . and let is take a look at the hardware the 9070 and the 9070 XT are two surprisingly different cards they both appear to use the same die they are both equipped with 16 gigs of memory on a 256-bit bus but the . XT is clocked way higher at darn near 3 hz and pulls a whopping extra 84 Watts on top of that it has eight more compute units and . it accelerators and 16 more . AI accelerators for an extra 392 tops all of which would be totally fine if the 9070 was not priced a mere $ 50 lower . and you are doing the thing again the 7900 XT got terrible reviews at launch because it was only $ 100 less than the . xt and it was way slower months later you discounted it when it was not selling and it picked up but the reviews were already out of the gate there is still time to fix this though $ 4.99 do it do it any who both cards regardless are quite . Future . Ready feature-wise with . pi Express . Gen 5 interfaces . him 2.1b and display port 2.1a although it is worth noting that not all . do 2.1a ports are made equal and adds support only 54 go per second compared to the 80 bit per second on vida is 50 Series in daily use this is unlikely to matter much since these cards are not really expected to be as powerful as vida is top pus and with display stream compression you should still be able to run a ok 240 HZ monitor but it is worth noting but what should we expect performance-wise well thanks to . for 4 maybe a lot as per usual you are going to have to wait for the reviews to drop from ourselves and others next week before you pull the trigger if their image comparisons are real and . I do not have reason yet to believe they are not real the image quality has improved so much that maybe you wo not mind bumping down from quality mode to . Performance . and like . vida is leaning on . AI and neural rendering for this and they are calling it . Fidelity . F super resolution for . my powered scaling this was teased almost a year ago and hey it looks like it is finally here the only issue is the lack of early support they i've got a decent list of 30 plus games at launch with over 75 more on the way for 2025 and . I would expect that to grow but do not buy promises buy what you can use today because there is no telling if your favorite game will or wo not end up being supported a feature that does support a much more sizable 1,000 plus games list is hyper . RX sort of it is a one-click solution that is been around for a while now and enables features like antiwar boost and . for with fluid motion frames 2.1 joining that roster and more coming soon in 2025 however since not all of those games benefit from every single one of those features your performance improvements will vary on a game to game basis and not everyone is a fan of frame generation regardless of whether those frames are green fake frames or red fake frames speaking of . Team . Green . Let is talk about availability cut after all who gives a single flying about anything that . and said today if the cards ca not be bought . I mean . I was super excited about the 50 Series until they were proven to be made out of unobtanium so you all have to forgive me for being a little jaded but . I mean these cards have been in the hands of retailers for months we saw samples at . yes in early . January with our own eyes . I i've got one in my hand now so when . and says wide availability . March 6 2025 there is a small small . Ray of . Hope inside me that has not quite withered and died yet and wants so desperately to believe them so . For the . Love of . All that is good please . Andy please do not this up if this is another paper launch it all just be my with reason why the . pu mark market right now is terrible and . Gamers should . Despair and . I do not want another reason like . Intel is b580 came out and booed my spirits it is a great budget card it is just that it is hard to find at or near . more and then vida is 50 Series has been trickling out into the market as if each one of them is artisanal whittle out of silicon by like one guy gamers want reasonably price cards they want them now and . and guys you i've got a real opportunity to gain actual market share here as long as your cards are not buggy and do not melt but hey good news . and claims that this launch will be the best driver support they i've ever had and considering how much they i've been delayed apparently . I actually kind of believe that they i've given the software team some extra time to cook and they even say they i've also improved their processes new . AI optimized internal testing increased number of hardware test configurations in the lab and a new bug report tool that is loaded directly into the driver will hopefully lead to a smoother launch experience but will it be a little smoother or a lot to smoother we ca not know until thousands of credit cards have been swiped and thousands of pus have played thousands of games and also output thousands of .

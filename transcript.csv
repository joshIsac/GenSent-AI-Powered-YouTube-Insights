you were on your way home when you died it was a car accident nothing particularly remarkable but fatal nonetheless it was a painless death the . Medics tried their best to save you but to no avail your body was so utterly shattered you were better off trust me and that is when you met me what happened where am . I you died . I said matter of fatly no point in mincing words there was there was a truck and it was skidding yes . I I died yes but do not feel bad about it everyone dies you looked around there was nothingness just you and me what is this place is this the afterlife more or less are you . God yes . I am . God my kids my wife what about them will they be all right that is what . I like to see . I said you just died and your main concern is for your family that is good stuff right there you looked at me with . Fascination to you . I did not look like . God . I just looked like some man or possibly a woman some vague authority figure maybe do not worry . I said they all be fine your kids will remember you as perfect in every way they did not have time to grow contemptuous of you your wife will cry on the outside but will be secretly relieved to be fair your marriage was falling apart if it is any consolation she all feel very guilty for feeling relieved oh so what happens now do . I go to heaven or hell or something neither you all be reincarnated ah so the . Hindus were right all religions are right in their own way walk with me you followed along as we strop through the void where are we going nowhere in particular it is just nice to walk while we talk so what is the point then when . I get reborn . I all just be a blank slate right a baby so all my experiences and everything everything . I did in this life wo not matter not so you have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives you just do not remember them right now . I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders your soul is more magnificent beautiful and gigantic than you can possibly imagine a human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are it is like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it is hot or cold you put a tiny . Part of . Yourself into the vessel and when you bring it back out you i've gained all the experiences it had you i've been in a human for the last 48 years so you have not stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense . Consciousness if we hung out here for long enough you i'd start remembering everything but there is no point to doing that between each life how many times have . I been reincarnated then oh lots lots and lots and into lots of different lives this time around you all be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 ad wait what you are sending me back in time well . I guess technically time as you know it only exists in your . Universe things are different . Where . I Come . From . Where where you come from oh sure . I come from somewhere somewhere else and there are others like me . I know you all want to know what it is like there but honestly you would not understand oh you said a little let down but wait if . I get reincarnated to other places in time . I could have interacted with myself at some point sure happens all the time and with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you do not even know it is happening so what is the point of it all . I looked you in the eye the meaning of life the reason . I made this whole universe is for you to mature you mean mankind you want to ask to mature no just you . I made this whole universe for you with each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect just me what about everyone else there is no one else in this universe there is just you and me you stared blankly at me but all the people on . Earth all you different incarnations of you wait . I am everyone now you are outing it . I am every human being who ever lived or who will ever live yes . I am . Abraham . Lincoln and you are . John will . Booth too . I am a Hitler you said a called and you are the millions he killed . I am . Jesus and you are everyone who followed him you fell silent every time you victimized someone you were victimizing yourself every act of kindness you i've done you i've done to yourself every happy and sad moment ever . ex experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you you thought for a long time why why do all this because someday you will become like me because that is what you are you are one of my kind you are my child wow you said incredulous you mean . I am a . God no not yet you are a fetus you are still growing once you i've lived every human life throughout all time you will have grown enough to be born so the whole universe it is just an egg . I answered now it is time for you to move on to your next life and . I sent you on your way [ Applause ] [ Applause ] [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Music ]
